‚ùì What is Ethereum?
üìù Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain that supports smart contracts.

üíé ETHEREUM & dAPPS üíé

dApps = decentralized applications, which can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

dApps are built on Ethereum using it's programming language, Solidity

Ethereum was originally proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2014. He proposed the development of a new blockchain platform with a Turing-complete programming language (Solidity).

‚ùì What is the native currency of Ethereum?
üìù ETH

‚ùì What are Smart Contracts?
üìù Smart contracts are small computer programs that are replicated and processed on all the computers on the Ethereum network without a central coordinator. Smart Contracts allow you to program contracts that can be automatically enforced by computer code.

üí° Cryptocurrency Tutorial (ERC20)
=================
‚ùå Build your first dApp

Remix IDE
--> It's good practice to use a license identifier
--> pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

--> OpenZepplin documentation is very important ‚ùóÔ∏è
üîó https://docs.openzeppelin.com
--> import OpenZepplin file - it's the stander used by the community. Very secure.

Use Standard ERC20
üîó https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20

--> Write contract LW3Token is ERC20 {
    constructor(string memoru _name, string memory _symbol) ERC20 (...)
    ...
}

--> Deploy & Run transactions


9.‚ùå=================
      LEVEL 9
üí° NFT Tutorial
=================
‚ùå Build your own cryptocurrency

Deploy a NFT project on Ethereum:

`
mkdir NFT-Tutorial
cd  NFT-Tutorial
npm init --yes
npm install --save-dev hardhat
`


`
npx hardhat
--> Select JavaScript project
`

`
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
`

ERC20 - Token to print money (a lot of similar, swapable);
ERC721 - Unique ID (it is not swapable);
ERC725 - Similar tokens in the same collection but different ID;

ALCHEMY API
üîó https://www.alchemyapi.io
--> It allows to run 10 nodes for free
--> Connect to Alchemy pasting the ALCHEMY_API_KEY_URL in .env file
--> Connect private key GOERLI_PRIVATE_KEY
--> Install the following environment:
`
npm install dotenv
`
