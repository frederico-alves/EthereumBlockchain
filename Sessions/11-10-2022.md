# Make your own NFT Collection with Smart Contracts

📄 Come and join the Blockchain Coding Café to spend time with other peers in the process of learning various on-chain programming. Everybody with an interest in Blockchain programming is welcome. Both students and non-students.

📄 It's possible to get guidance on both individual projects and learning materials.

📄 There is no strict agenda, besides blockchain programming with great people in cozy surroundings.

📄 We meet every Tuesday this autumn, and throughout the months we will go through CryptoZombies to learn Solidity-programming and the Freshman-track of LearnWeb3.io to get a general understanding of coding in web3.
