- Asger Balle Pedersen

IBM - Private mission with Blockchain

- Business networks, wealth and markets
- Transfering assets, building value

# LEDGER
- 1 - lefgers are transactions logs
- 2 - transaction - asset transfer
- 3 - constract - conditions for a transaction to occur

# Blockchain
- solves the problem of centralised ledgers
- shared, replicated, ledger
- smart contracts

# Differnt types of blockchain
- All blockchains aim to provide irrefutable prood that a set of transactions occured between participants

# Requirements of blockchain for business
- Assets
- Identity
- Endorsement

# Shadow Currency
- A currency that is not backed by a central bank
- Bitcoin

# Governance in the blockchain economy: A framework and research agenda

# PERMSSIONED BLOCKCHAIN
- A blockchain network that is controlled by a single entity or a small group of entities
- A permissioned blockchain is a private blockchain that is only accessible to a select group of users
- Permissioned blockchains are often used by companies to track transactions within their own organization


# PERMSSIONLESS BLOCKCHAIN
- A blockchain network that is open to anyone who wants to join
- Permissionless blockchains are often used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum
- Permissionless blockchains are often used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum

# Airdrop
- Airdrops are a way to distribute tokens to a large number of people without having to go through an exchange

# Algorand
- Algorand is a permissionless blockchain protocol that uses a novel Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm to achieve distributed consensus on the validity of transactions

# Bitcoin
- Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator. The network is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes through the use of cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.

# Ethereum
- Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality. It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions. Ether is a cryptocurrency generated by the Ethereum platform and used to compensate mining nodes for computations performed. Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes.
