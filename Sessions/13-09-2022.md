# Livecode NFT

Come and join the Blockchain Coding Café to spend time with other peers in the process of learning various on-chain programming. Everybody with an interest in Blockchain programming is welcome. Both students and non-students.

It's possible to get guidance on both individual projects and learning materials.

There is no strict agenda, besides blockchain programming with great people in cozy surroundings.

We meet every Tuesday this autumn, and throughout the months we will go through CryptoZombies to learn Solidity-programming and the Freshman-track of LearnWeb3.io to get a general understanding of coding in web3.
